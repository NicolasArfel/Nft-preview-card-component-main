## My process

I started with an HTML build.

I have divided each part into individual component.
Then I installed all the CSS part in a responsive way for a screen visibility of 375 px.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

```css
background: hsl(178, 100%, 50%, 0.3);
```
